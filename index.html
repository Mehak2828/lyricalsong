    <div>… You promised the world and I fell for it<br />
        I put you first and you adored it<br />
        Set fires to my forest<br />
        And you let it burn<br />
        Sang off-key in my chorus<br />
        'Cause it wasn't yours<br /></div>
    <div>
        … I saw the signs and I ignored it<br />
        Rose-colored glasses all distorted<br />
        Set fire to my purpose<br />
        And I let it burn<br />
        You got off on the hurtin'<br />
        When it wasn't yours, yeah<br />
    </div>
    <div>
        … We'd always go into it blindly<br />
        I needed to lose you to find me<br />
        This dancing was killing me softly<br />
        I needed to hate you to love me, yeah<br />
        … To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, yeah<br />
        I needed to lose you to love me, yeah<br />
        To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, yeah<br />
        I needed to lose you to love me<br /></div>
    <div>
        … I gave my all and they all know it<br />
        Then you tore me down and now it's showing<br />
        In two months, you replaced us<br />
        Like it was easy<br />
        Made me think I deserved it<br />
        In the thick of healing, yeah<br />
        … We'd always go into it blindly<br />
        I needed to lose you to find me<br />
        This dancing was killing me softly<br />
        I needed to hate you to love me, yeah<br />
        … To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, love, yeah<br />
        To love, yeah<br />
        I needed to lose you to love me, yeah<br />
        To love, love, yeah<br />
